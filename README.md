# bribe

```
Alas! the small discredit of a bribe
Scarce hurts the lawyer, but undoes the scribe.

â€“ Alexander Pope, "Epilogue to Satire"

`bribe` is a small utility that aggregates the licenses of [Stack][stack] projects in a manner compatible with that of [`licensed`][licensed]. In contrast to `licensed`, `bribe` does not actually build a Haskell project, instead inferring license information from the output of `stack ls dependencies`.

[licensed]: https://github.com/github/licensed
[stack]: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack

## Usage

`bribe COMMAND -p PROJECT -d DIRECTORY`

* `COMMAND` is either `check` or `update`; `check` just reports results, whereas `update` tries to remedy them.
* `PROJECT` is the name of the cabal project to report on.
* `DIRECTORY` is the absolute or relative directory in which to check for the `.licensed` directory.

A `check` command will fail with a non-zero exit code if there are any licenses that are present but outdated. Missing licenses will produce a warning.
