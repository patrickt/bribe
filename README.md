`bribe` is a small utility that aggregates the licenses of [Stack][stack] projects in a manner compatible with that of [`licensed`][licensed]. In contrast to `licensed`, `bribe` does not actually build a Haskell project, instead inferring license information from the output of `stack ls dependencies`.
